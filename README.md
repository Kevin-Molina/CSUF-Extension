## CSUF Registration Aid

Google Chrome Extension that modifies CSUF's course registration page.  Extension links to all found ratemyprofessor pages and display professor data on hover with Bootstrap's popover.

## Motivation

Designed to speed up class registration process. No more opening up 5 different tabs and grinding out searches to evaluate professors while the clock is ticking to pick a class before it gets filled. Ultimately, I wanted to create something I would use and be excited to show off. 


## Installation

Extension will be accessible from Chrome Extension store December 2017 for student use moving forward.
